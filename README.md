Simple HTML project!

I built a basic recipe website.

We have the Homepage, which includes a title, an image, some paragraphs and an unordered list of relative links to 3 recipes.

Every recipe page is more or less the same.
Title, subtitle, image, one or two paragraphs, one unordered list of ingredients, one ordered list of instructions and a "back to homepage" link.
