            I present you with yet another dip. Greeks <em>loooove</em> their dips.
            As stated in the subtitle, Tyrokafteri literally means hot cheese,
            so you know what you're getting into. The name sometimes changes from region
            to region. In Crete, for example, will call it kopanisti. But, personally,
            I find the name Tyrokafteri better, because it tells you what to expect!
