            Tzatziki is the most popular garlicky cucumber Greek yogurt sauce, dip of spread
            (call it whatever you like) in Greece! It's mostly served with grilled meats and gyros.
            It's also <em>extremely</em> easy to make.

            <strong>Personal opinion</strong>: The most garlic the better,
            but not everyone is like me, so <em>always</em> keep your guest in mind.
            (I learned that the hard way!)
