        alt="Greek Frappe">

        <p>Before I share the recipe, let me say this:</p>
        <p>As a Greek, who drinks <em>at least</em>  one glass a day,
        the best result is <strong>ALWAYS</strong>  achieved by hand. You can, of course,
        use an electric wheezer or whatever, but I don't recommend it.
        Just use a standard cocktail shaker and shake by hand!</p>
        
        <p>Now, let's talk variations:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>"Sketos": plain, no sugar</li>
            <li>"Metrios": medium sweetness, use equal amount of coffee and sugar</li>
            <li>"Glykos": sweet, the sougar is double the amount of the coffee</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To all of theese variations you can add 1 tbsp of evaporated milk. I don't recommend it, though.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2-3 tsp instant coffee</li>
            <li>sugar (unless you're going for sketos)</li>
            <li>3-4 ice cubes</li>
            <li>1 glassful of cold water</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>In the shaker, add 2-3 tsp of cold water.
                (You want just enough to cover the coffee.) Add coffee, sugar and the ice cubes.
            </li>
            <li>Shake until a thick, creamy foam is produced. If your hand starts to
                hurt, work through the pain. Frappe is for the strong!!!
                Also, the foam is <strong><em>very, very, very important</em></strong>!
                You have to make it just right!
            </li>
            <li>Pour in a tall glass, fill up with cold water an serve with a drinking straw.</li>
        </ol>
